The code examples about thread in Python that using thread locks and queues to manage data so that access to the CPU and data can be synchronized across multiple threads. Generally it accepts a function name as the first parameter and a set of arguments as the second. THe optional third parameter allows you to pass a dictionary containing keyword arguments.
